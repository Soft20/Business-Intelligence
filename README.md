### Resume

The scope of this project was to research different topics that could be discussed in relation to Business Intelligence. We would then have to find some data supporting the subject, which we later would experiment with in Tableau Desktop. The experimenting would consist of processing the data and visualizing them in different diagrams. We decided our topic should focus on the social media and its effect on people's perception of 'The Perfect Life'. After finding and processing some data regarding the subject, we chose to focus on the correlation between the growth of social media and the rise of mental health problems. One of the most common mental health problems is stress, which is why we chose to develop a linear regressor model to predict the probability of getting it based on given parameters.
As a result of our project we found a connection between the growth of social media and the increase of mental health problems.
