###  Case 1 | Corona
  
  
####  Context
  
  
This case discuses the corona infection spread and its relation to the precautions made with masks, hand disinfection, distance etc.
  
There are many disagreements between the strategies to reduce the infections. We will search for data that can support the strategy.
  
####  Purpose
  
  
The final result will determine the best strategy to reduce the infection spread based on our data.
  
####  Questions
  
  
-   Is the impact of wearing a mask effective?
    -   Inside/ Outside?
    -   Sitting down/ Standing up?
    -   Public Areas?
-   Is the impact of hand disinfection effective?
-   Does the amount of people gathering together have an effect?
    -   Small gatherings?
    -   Large gatherings?
-   Selling alcohol after 10 PM?
-   Closing borders between countries?
  
####  Hypothesis
  
  
We expect the usage of masks, hand disinfection and distance all contribute to a reduction in the infection spread.
  
However the guidelines of masks in public areas such as fitness centers, restaurants etc. won't make too much of a difference in our opinion. Due to the the requirements to only wear a mask when arriving and leaving.

###  Case 2 | Social Media & The "Perfect Life"
  
  
####  Context
  
  
This case discuses how social media has an impact on how people perceives the "perfect life" standards as reality. Standards such as fancy cars and houses, expensive foods, beauty filters and more.
  
####  Purpose
  
  
The purpose with this case is to expose the reality behind the perfect life and the fact that the majority of influencers on social media only share the positive and beautified aspects of their life.
  
####  Questions
  
  
-   Does the younger generation grow up with a wrong sense of reality based on social media?
-   Does social media contribute to the rise of health care issues?
    -   such as anorexia, bulimia, anxiety, etc.?
-   Does social media have an impact on loneliness?
-   Does photo editing contribute to an unrealistic view of reality?
  
####  Hypothesis
  
  
We believe social media can be intoxicating on multiple fronts in the perception of the perfect life. However the impact depends on how much you let it consume your everyday life.
